# NotAnotherCSGOAimbot
Unfinished OpenCV project proof of concept

This is an unfinished, poorly optimized aimbot that uses HSV filters and keypoints to detect CT players on dust_2.
I got less than ideal results from using the HSV filters and keypoints so I decided to try training a custom haar cascade
to detect CT players but this proved to be extremely time and hardware resource consuming. 

I know there are much easier ways to do this with lower level solutions but I thought this would be a good way to get familiar with OpenCV
and cascade classifiers.
